# RAGpedia

Welcome to **RAGpedia** – a comprehensive repository dedicated to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** tools and benchmarks. Our goal is to centralize information on all published RAG models, tools, and benchmarks, making it easier for researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts to explore, compare, and understand the landscape of RAG developments.

## Purpose and Intended Outcomes

- **Centralized Knowledge**: RAGpedia aims to be the ultimate resource for all things RAG, providing detailed insights, references, and links for each tool and benchmark.
- **Accessibility**: By aggregating and categorizing RAG models and benchmarks, we offer an accessible resource for everyone, from beginners to experts, to stay informed on the latest advancements.
- **Community Contributions**: We encourage contributions from the community to keep the list updated with new tools, benchmarks, or RAG-related resources, fostering a collaborative environment.

## Key Contents

- [**RAG-LIST.md**](RAG-LIST.md): This file is the heart of RAGpedia, containing entries for all publicly available RAG tools and benchmarks. Each entry includes the name, description, discoverer, GitHub repository link, and paper link, allowing easy access to detailed information.

## Contribution

We welcome and appreciate contributions from the community to keep RAGpedia a valuable, up-to-date resource. Whether you’re adding new RAG tools, benchmarks, tutorial code, or Jupyter Notebooks (IPYNB) for learning and experimenting with RAG models, your input will enhance the knowledge shared here.

### How You Can Contribute

1. **Adding New Tools or Benchmarks**: If you’re aware of any new or underrepresented RAG models or benchmarks, please follow our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to submit them. Be sure to include details like the name, description, discoverer, GitHub repository, and paper link.
   
2. **Tutorials and Learning Resources**: To help users learn and apply RAG techniques, we encourage contributions of tutorial code or Jupyter Notebooks (IPYNB) with practical examples. These can cover basic setups, specific use cases, or advanced tuning and configuration tips. Include comments and explanations where possible to guide learners.

3. **Improving Documentation**: If you spot any information that could be refined, corrected, or expanded upon, please feel free to make edits. Better documentation helps make RAGpedia accessible and helpful to a wider audience.

We look forward to your contributions to make RAGpedia a collaborative and comprehensive resource for the RAG community!
